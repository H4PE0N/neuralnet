#Todo:
- fix input system for input and output nodes in master.c
- adjust inputs after training prepared data when forward
- split up dataset into training and testing data
- create loding bar for when the network is training
- create account on kaggle and download datasets
- automaticly detect which headers is onehot and nrmliz
- implement size t instead of int
- create enums for return value for error handling
- check out the use of errno and maybe implement it
- make it possible to save trained model to file
- normilize inputs based on normalized dataset

#Programs
1. train model to mimic dataset
2. train model to mimic image
3. train model to recognize images (categorial)
